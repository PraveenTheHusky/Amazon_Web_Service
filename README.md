-How to use different AWS Machine Learning frameworks like: 

   		-SageMaker
   		-TextExtract
   		-Rekognition
   		-S3(Common, not a ML framework/module)
   
-To start with your project using AWS, we have to keep some basics concepts in our mind.
 		
	(Tip: For students, you can apply for student account through AWS as well as on Github through which you will get free         credits which can help to complete your initial projects for free)
   
-How to start with each ML module: Read AWS docs for each ML frameworks it provides, also they provide examples for each  methods/functions they have, with some tweeks we can write our own functions.
 
-Working with Sagemaker:

	-Creating an instance.
	-Creating dedicated role for your instance and giving access to use your S3 bucket.
	-Attaching policies we are going to use within our projects.
